We need to find similar websites for a tech event. The event details are:

{{event_details}}

Your task is to search for existing tech event websites that are similar in function and structure to the one we're creating. These will serve as references for our project.
Important guidelines:
1. Focus exclusively on finding similar tech event websites, not general design resources.
2. DO NOT search for terms like "design inspiration", "design trends", or "website inspiration".
3. Tailor your search queries to find specific, relevant examples of tech event websites.
4. Search for keywords in the event details.
5. Look for websites of related organizations or companies mentioned in the event details, and search for their tech events or hackathons.

Follow these steps:
1. Identify the key aspects of the tech event website we're designing.
2. Determine the most relevant types of tech event websites to search for.
3. Identify any related organizations or companies mentioned in the event details.
4. Generate a list of specific search queries targeting similar tech event websites, including those of related organizations.
5. Execute these search queries to find relevant examples.
